Welcome !
=========

This is Peter Troeger's (https://github.com/troeger) reference implementation of the DRMAAv2 C language binding
with some changes in the headers to make it compatible with univa's version so that I can compile drmaa2.go version
on Mac OS.

If you don't know what DRMAA is, please consult http://www.drmaa.org.

The code base is maintained by members of the Open Grid Forum (OGF) DRMAA group. 
The intention is to have a common starting point for true product implementations of the DRMAAv2 C language binding. 
The source code licence is 'newBSD', which should allow you the unrestricted usage in both closed source and open source projects.

This implementation is only a mock, since it maps the job submission and monitoring
facilities of DRMAA to forked local processes only. DRM system vendors can re-use generic
parts (such as list or persistence handling) and add only their product-specific job
handling extensions.

We would be happy if you give us a hint if this code was helpful for you.
Additions to the test suite and forks are also more than welcome.
